# Product Cost Analysis - InEight Document AI Chatbot

## 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the estimated monthly cloud costs for hosting the InEight Document AI Chatbot MVP on Microsoft Azure.
**Overall Estimated Cost: ~$5.00 - $15.00 USD / Month** (assuming agile use of Free Tiers and "Pay-As-You-Go" AI services).

> [!NOTE]
> Prices are estimates based on "East US" region rates and minimal MVP usage data. Actual costs may vary.

## 2. Service Cost Breakdown

### 2.1 Compute & Hosting
| Service | Tier / Plan | Monthly Free Limits | Estimated Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Azure App Service** | **F1 (Free)** | 60 CPU mins/day, 1 GB RAM, 10 Apps | **$0.00** | Shared infrastructure. No SLA. Good for Dev/Test. |
| **Azure Static Web Apps** | **Free** | 100 GB Bandwidth/month | **$0.00** | For hosting the React Frontend (Optional alternative to App Service). |

### 2.2 Database & Storage
| Service | Tier / Plan | Monthly Free Limits | Estimated Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Azure SQL Database** | **Serverless (Free Offer)** | 100,000 vCore seconds, 32 GB Storage | **$0.00** | "Free Forever" offer for one DB per subscription. Auto-pauses when idle. |
| **Azure Blob Storage** | **Standard Hot (LRS)** | Access to 5GB (12 months free for new accounts) | **<$1.00** | ~$0.018 per GB. For MVP (PDFs), cost is negligible. |

### 2.3 AI & Search (The Cost Drivers)
| Service | Tier / Plan | Pricing Model | Estimated Cost | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Azure OpenAI** | **Standard (Pay-As-You-Go)** | **GPT-4o-mini**: <br>Input: $0.15 / 1M tokens <br>Output: $0.60 / 1M tokens | **~$5.00** | Assuming moderate testing usage (e.g., 5-10M tokens). <br>*GPT-4o is significantly more expensive ($2.50/$10.00).* |
| **Azure AI Search** | **Free** | 50 MB Storage, 3 Indexes | **$0.00** | **Critical Limitation**: Free tier supports Vector Search but capacity is very small (50MB). <br>**Upgrade Risk**: The next tier ("Basic") jumps to **~$75/mo**. |

## 3. Cost Optimization Strategy (MVP)

To keep the project strictly within the ~$10 range:

1.  **Use GPT-4o-mini**: It is orders of magnitude cheaper than GPT-4o and sufficient for RAG summarization.
2.  **Stay on AI Search Free Tier**: Limit the number of indexed documents to <50 MB (approx. 50-100 PDFs depending on content).
    -   *Fallback*: If 50MB is too restrictive, we should implement a **Local Vector Store** (using Postgres pgvector or in-memory FAISS) running on the App Service to avoid the $75/mo Basic Search cost.
3.  **Leverage Serverless SQL**: Ensure the database is set to "Auto-Pause" to save vCore seconds, though the free limit is generous for dev.

## 4. Conclusion
For the MVP phase, Azure provides a robust set of Free Tiers that cover Hosting and Database. The primary cost will be **Azure OpenAI consumption**, which is usage-based.

**Expected Monthly Bill: < $15.00 USD**
